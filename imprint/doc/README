Please refer to the files in the directory ./original/ for copyright
notices etc. Just a short explanation for this version:

I have stripped lots of stuff from the original imprint app,
especially the attempt place links to the imprint at fancy locations
by attaching additional html-tags to specific tags generated by the
core Owncloud layout machinery. This was just to instable. What
remains is an imprint app which can

* display the imprint notice when used as an ordinary OC app

* can be displayed on a guest page; here it also provides a back-link
  to the login page. However, the link on the front page which refers
  to the imprint-note has to generated by theming. The
  OCROOT/themes/README file contains some information on this, a
  simple example is also located in this directory below
  "imprinttheme/". Customize and rename to your needs.
